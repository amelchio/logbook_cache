# Logbook Cache for Home Assistant

Custom component to speed up Home Assistant logbook viewing.

This works by keeping filtered results preloaded and updated in memory. The effect is most significant with slow hardware such as Raspberry Pi.

Caveats:
- the cache takes some time (maybe several minutes) to warm up after each restart
- watch the memory usage if you have a huge log
